Defeat the Evil Wizard
A turn-based battle game built in Python. You choose a hero and fight the Evil Wizard.

Characters
You can choose from 4 character classes - Warrior, Mage, Archer and Paladin. Each one has different stats and 2 unique special abilities.

How to play
Each turn you can attack, use a special ability, heal, or view your stats. The wizard regenerates health every turn so you need to keep the pressure on. The game ends when either you or the wizard runs out of health.

📋 PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
Create Your Own Character Classes:

Add two new character classes in addition to Warrior and Mage. Examples include:

Archer: A ranged attacker with abilities to shoot arrows and evade attacks.

Paladin: A defensive hero who can heal and shield against attacks.

Implement Special Abilities:

Each character must have two unique abilities, such as:

Archer: "Quick Shot" (double arrow attack) and "Evade" (evades the next attack ).

Paladin: "Holy Strike" (bonus damage) and "Divine Shield" (blocks the next attack).

Add a Healing Mechanic:

Implement a heal() method that restores health but does not exceed the maximum.

Randomize Attack Damage:

Modify the attack() method to deal random damage within a range.

Build a Turn-Based Battle System:

Players must choose actions such as attacking, healing, using abilities, or viewing stats.

Evil Wizard Logic:

The evil wizard should regenerate health and attack the player after each turn.

Display Victory/Defeat Messages:

End the game with a victory message for the player or a defeat message if the wizard wins.
